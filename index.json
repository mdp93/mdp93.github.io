Together with more automotive electronics and wireless interfaces, the number of possible attack surfaces increases, raising security concerns. Attacks on cars can have multiple implications, ranging from financial incentives or damage to the compromise of human safety. Although attacks vary, all of them have one component in common, namely CAN bus injection. The CAN bus is the de-facto technology used inside the in-vehicle network to interconnect automotive controllers. An attacker who compromises the CAN bus can inject arbitrary CAN messages to it, making the vehicle misbehave. As a result, countermeasures against the CAN bus attacks need to be implemented by carmakers. Unfortunately, the carmakers have been reluctant to adopt any approach proposed thus far to secure CAN. The main reasons for this reluctance are that (i) CAN injection requires the knowledge of semantics which differs from vehicle to vehicle and is proprietary to the car-makers, as well as (ii) industry-specific functional and cost constraints which have not been reflected in the existing solutions. Any solution that accounts for these constraints has to incur minimal overhead on computational resources and message latency. I address these two points by first showing that proprietary semantics can be automatically reverse-engineered, effectively removing the barrier for CAN injection attacks. I demonstrated this by developing LibreCAN which can quickly and accurately reverse engineer both automotive powertrain- and body-related information in an automated fashion. Adversaries can significantly accelerate their preparation time for a CAN injection attack by obtaining the semantics which car-makers were trying to keep secret by not disclosing it publicly. Second, to meet the industry-specific constraints, I propose S2-CAN and MichiCAN. The former adds confidentiality, authenticity and integrity to the CAN bus without the overhead of cryptography, but by leveraging protocol-specific properties. The latter protects the CAN bus against attacks on its availability, e.g., Denial of Service, by leveraging novel hardware features of automotive controllers. Its main difference from existing work is practicality. Instead of adapting well-known cryptographic techniques from the realm of computer networks which do not satisfy the aforementioned cost and functional constraints, I propose out-of-the-box solutions that leverage protocol- and hardware-based features of automotive networks and controllers. Furthermore, both S2-CAN and MichiCAN are fully backward-compatible with existing hardware and specifications, as well as incur minimal computation and network overheads. CAN injection attacks can also be conducted remotely by accepting malicious data from other cars in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication scenarios. I propose textbf{CARdea}, a two-phase anomaly detection system that sanitizes incoming data from surrounding vehicles. Compared to computationally-intensive prior work, CARdea combines an in-vehicle light-weight anomaly detection phase with a more resource-heavy machine-learning phase that can be executed on the vehicle, edge or cloud based on available computational resources and manufacturer constraints. Overall, this dissertation demonstrates the omnipresence of CAN injection attacks and develops novel, practical security solutions for CAN and V2X by analyzing the inherent trade-off between security and performance.","tags":[],"title":"Bringing Practical Security to Vehicles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mert D.

Several vulnerabilities, such as eavesdropping, spoofing, and replay attacks, have shown that the current implementation needs to be extended. Both academic and commercial solutions for a Secure CAN (S-CAN) have been proposed, but OEMs have not yet integrated them into their products. The main reasons for this lack of adoption are their heavy use of limited computational resources in the vehicle, increased latency that can lead to missed deadlines for safety-critical messages, as well as insufficient space available in a CAN frame to include a Message Authentication Code (MAC). By making a trade-off between security and performance, we develop S2-CAN, which overcomes the aforementioned problems of S-CAN. We leverage protocol-specific properties of CAN instead of using cryptographic primitives and design a “sufficiently secure” alternative CAN with minimal overhead on resources and latency. We evaluate the security of S2-CAN in four real-world vehicles by an automated vehicular attack tool.We finally show that CAN security can be guaranteed by the correct choice of a design parameter while achieving acceptable performance.","tags":[],"title":"S2-CAN: Sufficiently Secure Controller Area Network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mert D.

Besides OEM apps and services, the next generation of IVI platforms are expected to offer integration of third-party apps. Under this anticipated business model, vehicular sensor and event data can be collected and shared with selected third-party apps. To accommodate this trend, Google has been pushing towards standardization among proprietary IVI operating systems with their Android Automotive platform which runs natively on the vehicle’s IVI platform. Unlike Android Auto’s limited functionality of display-projecting certain smartphone apps to the IVI screen, Android Automotive will have access to the in-vehicle network (IVN), and will be able to read and share various vehicular sensor data with third-party apps. This increased connectivity opens new business opportunities for both the car manufacturer as well as third-party businesses, but also introduces a new attack surface on the vehicle. Therefore, Android Automotive must have a secure system architecture to prevent any potential attacks that might compromise the security and privacy of the vehicle and the driver. In particular, malicious third-party entities could remotely compromise a vehicle's functionalities and impact the vehicle safety, causing financial and operational damage to the vehicle, as well as compromise the driver’s privacy and safety. This paper presents an Android Automotive system architecture and provides guidelines for conducting a high-level security analysis. It also describes what countermeasures have already been taken by Google to prevent potential attacks, and discusses what still needs to be done in order to offer a secure and privacy-preserving Android experience for next-generation IVI platforms.","tags":[],"title":"Security Analysis of Android Automotive","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mert D.

Furthermore, CAVs have not only physical interfaces but also increased data connectivity to the Internet via their Telematic Control Units (TCUs), enabling remote access via mobile devices. It is also possible to tap into, and read/write data from/to the CAN bus, as data transmitted on the CAN bus is not encrypted. This naturally generates concerns about automotive cybersecurity. One commonality among most vehicular security attacks reported to date is that they ultimately require write access to the CAN bus.

The European Union has established a privacy standard called General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018. Furthermore, the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data incident made headlines in March 2018. Data collection from vehicles by OEM platforms is increasingly popular and may offer OEMs new business models but it comes with the risk of privacy leakages. Vehicular sensor data shared with third-parties can lead to misuse of the requested data for other purposes than stated/intended. There exists a relevant regulation document introduced by the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers (“Auto Alliance”), which classifies the vehicular sensors used for data collection as covered and non-sensitive parameters. This paper reviews existing privacy standards as well as ongoing efforts in the automotive domain, and surveys the landscape of automotive privacy-related attacks which can be classified into three categories, driver fingerprinting, location inferencing and driving-behavior analysis. These three categories are derived from the aforementioned guidelines of covered information. Based on this survey, we define a Privacy Score (PS), quantifying the risk associated with each vehicular sensor. Sensors contributing to multiple privacy attacks will be assigned a higher PS. Furthermore, combinations of sensors used in privacy attacks must be considered and assessed in the PS metric as some attacks cannot be mounted using a single independent sensor alone.","tags":[],"title":"Survey of Automotive Privacy Regulations and Privacy-Related Attacks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mert D.

This paper presents a context-aware intrusion detection system (CAID) framework capable to recognize manipulations of the physical system using cyber means. CAID uses sensor information to establish reference models of the physical system and then checks correctness of current sensor data against the reference models. Thereby, it establishes the notion of plausibility of a controller’s operation. CAID augments today’s cyber physical intrusion detection systems (IDS) by adding a physical model to the detection engine. The CAID framework has been evaluated in a vehicular setup using test vehicle. Telemetry data has been collected from a test vehicle that has then been chip-tuned with a commercially available chip-tuning tool to obtain manipulated data. CAID was able to recognize the chip tuning with a very high probability using an unsupervised Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

Security concepts based on the closed-world assumption cannot be deployed anymore due to a constantly changing adversary model. Automotive Ethernet as future in-vehicle network and a new E/E Architecture have different security requirements than Ethernet known from traditional IT and legacy systems. In order to achieve a high level of security, a new multi-layer approach in the vehicle which responds to special automotive requirements has to be introduced. One essential layer of this holistic security concept is to restrict non-authorized access by the deployment of embedded firewalls. This paper addresses the introduction of automotive firewalls into the next-generation domain architecture with a focus on partitioning of its features in hardware and software. Based on the deployment of the firewall in the in-vehicle network, the corresponding adversary model and automotive requirements such as latency, jitter, CPU load and memory consumption are going to be discussed. Drivers behind these metrics are primarily safety concerns and cost and thus are relevant for both OEMs and hardware manufacturers. As a result, a reasonable implementation of an automotive firewall system has to be a trade-off between hardware and software in order to meet the above-named automotive requirements. We implemented the firewall on an Infineon AURIX TriCore and Altera Cyclone V FPGA to analyze these metrics. The paper shows the options and decision points to find an optimal partitioning between hardware and software for an automotive embedded firewall system.","tags":[],"title":"HW/SW Co-Design of an Automotive Embedded Firewall","type":"publication"}]
